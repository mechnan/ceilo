0.) take all informations (station measurements, instrumental PBL, etc.) into account (we should try to get the most physically correct detection)

1.) is manual detection possible ? (is it possible to follow a layer during the day with good confidence for a resonable amount of time ?)

2.1) in case of cloud: detect at cloud base.
2.2) in case of fog/low stratus: detection allowed when it begins to dissipate.
2.3) in case of precip: detection possible only during time intervals without precip of at least 2h duration

3.1) for CBL, begin after sunrise, end before sunset.
3.2) look for a CBL decay when vertical heat flux is about 0 and deltaT is "frankly" smaller than 0 at the end of the day. If no decaying layer can be followed, make no detection.
3.3) keep in mind that CBL should start developping from the ground after sunrise, i.e. don't look at too elevated layers in the morning.

4.) if possible, try to put as many points as necessary such that a linear interpolation between the points would trustworthy depict the short-term evolution of the observed layer.

Have fun !
